                        <h2>Research Interest</h2>
                        <p>
My interest primarily lies in building quantitative models that provide algorithmic and/or mathematical framework for cortical processes underlying everyday tasks such as recognition of faces and objects (curious to know if it extends to recognition of voice/music). Currently, at <a href="http://cvnlab.net/" target="_blank">                
                                    Computational Visual Neuroscience Lab</a>, I’m developing a  fully generative model that factors in both bottom-up, sensory-driven responses 
				and top-down, goal-driven attentional state, connections to accurately characterize cortical responses for arbitrary combinations of stimuli and attentional loci. 
				In  the past, I focussed on applying 
 signal processing and machine learning to extract inherent patterns in Magnetic Resonance (MR) images,  both in native image space and in frequency space (also called k-space) at the time of its acquisition.

Swarm optimization algorithms which are motivated by the hierarchical working,
efficient self-organizing skills and highly developed foraging ability of the
bee population are being increasingly used in wide array fields. In this paper, we
propose a novel data-driven algorithm, using swarm intelligence of artificial bee
colony (ABC), called k-ABC, to generate an adaptive variable density sampling
(VDS) scheme for compressive sampling (CS) based data acquisition for fast
MR imaging. The algorithm exploits the behaviour of the three types of bees -
scout-bees, employed-bees and onlooker bees, with certain modifications based
on the characteristics of variable density sampling. We introduce the concept of
searching for the high quality food sources in annular regions of varying widths,
called as bins, to optimise the process of foraging. The k-ABC algorithm uses
magnitude k-space distribution of a reference single-slice MR image as the underlying
tness value distribution to generate an adaptive sampling scheme. We
have also addressed the problem of designing a tailor-made template sampling
scheme for 3D MR volume imaging for the very first time. Retrospective simulations
show that the proposed k-ABC adaptive VDS scheme gives significant
improvement over other sampling schemes for both single slice and multi-slice
MR imaging. Further, for the task of implementation, a modified projection
algorithm that takes into account the location of each sample in k-space has
been introduced, which provides a significant improvement in the reconstructed
image quality with minimum trade-off in terms of scan-time.

There exists an inherent characteristic distribution in the magnitude spectrum of the Fourier Transform of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images,
also referred to as k-space, the high energy samples being concentrated near the center of the magnitude k-space and low energy samples at larger distances.
However, there is no method that directly takes into account both the spatial location and the energy contained by a sample, 
while generating a variable density sampling (VDS) distribution. In this paper,
we propose two methods that exploit the underlying structure in MR images and produce adaptive, organ-specific, VDS schemes. First,a weighted K-Means algorithm, an unsupervised learning method,
that groups or bins samples with similar energy level weighted by its distance from the center of k-space. Second, a simple binning-based approach
that maximizes the overall energy content of the sampling scheme and minimizes the average distance between neighboring samples. 
Extensive retrospective CS-MRI simulations have shown that the proposed methods perform significantly better than the existing adaptive methodologies.

Categorisation of huge amount of data on the
multimedia platform is a crucial task. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to address the subtle problem of selfie detection
for image database segregation on the web, given rapid rise
in the number of selfies being clicked. A Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) is modeled to learn a synergy feature in the
common subspace of head and shoulder orientation, derived
from Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented
Gradients (HOG) features respectively. This synergy was captured
by projecting the aforementioned features using Canonical
Correlation Analysis (CCA). We show that the resulting networks
convolutional activations in the neighbourhood of spatial keypoints
captured by SIFT are discriminative for selfie-detection. In
general, proposed approach aids in capturing intricacies present
in the image data and has the potential for usage in other
subtle image analysis scenarios apart from just selfie detection.
We investigate and analyse the performance of the popular
CNN architectures (GoogleNet, Alexnet), used for other image
classification tasks, when subjected to the task of detecting the
selfies on the multimedia platform. The results of the proposed
approach are compared with these popular architectures on a
dataset of ninety thousand images comprising of roughly equal
number of selfies and non-selfies. Experimental results on this
dataset shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Detection of the start and the end time of words in a
continuous speech plays a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy
of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Hence, addressing the
problem of efficiently demarcating word boundaries is of prime
importance. In this paper, we introduce two new acoustic features
based on higher order statistics called Density of Voicing (DoV)
and Variability of Voicing (VoV) obtained from the bispectral
distribution, which when used along with the popular prosodic
cues helps in drastically reducing the recognition error rate involved.
An ensemble of three different models has been designed
to minimize the false alarms, during word boundary detection, by
maximizing the uncorrelatedness in prediction from each model.
Finally, the majority-voting rule was used to decide if the given
frame encompasses a word boundary. The contribution of the
work lies in: (i) Converting word boundary detection into a
supervised learning problem (ii) Introduction of two new higher
order statistical features (iii) Using ensemble methods to find
the best model for prediction. Experimental results for NTIMIT
Database shows the efficacy of the proposed method and its
robustness to noise added during telephonic transmission.

The self-sustained dynamics of the bee population in
nature is a result of their hierarchical working culture, efficient
organizing skills and unique highly developed foraging ability,
which enables them to interact effectively among each other as
well as with their environment. In this paper, a novel algorithm
utilizing the bees swarm intelligence, and its heuristics based on
quality and quantity of food sources (nectars) is proposed to generate
a variable density sampling (VDS) scheme for compressive
sampling (CS) based fast MRI data acquisition. The algorithm
uses the scout-bees for global random selection process which
is further fine-tuned by employed and onlooker-bees who forage
locally in the neighborhood giving prime importance to points
possessing high fitness values (or high energy) usually located
around the center of k-space. The algorithm introduces the
concept of searching for the high quality food sources in annular
regions, called as bins, of varying widths. Retrospective CS-MRI simulations show that the proposed k-ABC based VDS scheme
performs significantly better than other sampling schemes.
